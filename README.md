# PrimerPickerProgram

First, two important packages are loaded, and two files are read.

The packages are:

Modules2, a seperate python script which should be located in the same folder as this jupyter notebook. It includes the functions and class that are used for running the script
Pandas, an open source Python package that is most widely used for data science/data analysis and machine learning tasks, essential for running this program
The files are:

Primer3Output, which should be saved as "Primer3Output.txt", and be located in the same folder as this file. You can simply copy all the text from the output page of Primer3 into a text file, and save it with the same name.
Gene alignment, in fasta foramat. As an example, GH9Alignment.fas is used. You can open this file to see the proper format. If desired, you can use your own file by changing the name between the quotation marks to the name (make sure to include the extension, .fas or .fasta etc.)

Example files "Primer3Output.txt" and "GH9Alignment.fas" are added
